# CS449-Sprint-00

You can run  this code in VS Code, but first, you need to install Python and the Tkinter library (which usually comes with Python).

All of the code includes comments explaining what each part does. 

For sos_gui_tkinter.py when you run it if you check out the check box,  a message will pop up "Check box is checked!"
